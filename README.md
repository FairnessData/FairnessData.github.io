This is a call to action to help **prevent the loss of federal, especially HUD data, on racial discrimination**.

## Background
[HR482](https://www.govtrack.us/congress/bills/115/hr482) and [S103](https://www.govtrack.us/congress/bills/115/s103) drafts for the 115th Congress include language that:

*"...no Federal funds may be used to design, build, maintain, utilize, or provide access to a Federal database of geospatial information on community racial disparities or disparities in access to affordable housing."* (Section 3)

## Call to Action and How to Protect Yourself
* Consider creating another GitHub account for this purpose rather than one that can I identify yourself.
* Nominate any datasets that could possibly be construed to meet the restriction above by starting an issue in https://github.com/FairnessData/datasets.
* **Do not provide** any information that is clearly proprietary and could identify yourself or others. 
* Please do not as yet 'claim' a dataset or identify yourself. Rather, comment on the open issues or create a new issue if you don't see the dataset.
* Again, again: identifying yourself could hurt yourself or others around you or your career.

Thank you for your support!
